# stratascratch_sql_puzzles

## About:
A fun way to practice using joins, window functions, subqueries, common table expressions, and more, including documentation of my logic and multiple solutions in certain cases.  All SQL queries are written in PostgreSQL and are solutions to Freemium puzzles found on [StrataScratch](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding?questionType=2%2C1&company=&topic=&curated_filter=&is_correct_solution=&is_bookmarked=&is_freemium=true&in_depth_solution=&difficulty=&code_type=1&python=&filters=&page=1&page_size=100).

## How to use this repository:
I've organized my solutions into folders, based on difficulty level: [Easy](https://github.com/papir805/stratascratch_SQL_puzzles/tree/main/Easy), [Medium](https://github.com/papir805/stratascratch_SQL_puzzles/tree/main/Medium), and [Hard](https://github.com/papir805/stratascratch_SQL_puzzles/tree/main/Hard).  Once inside any folder, click on a .sql file to view the problem statement, the corresponding link to the StrataScratch website for that puzzle, and the query I've written to solve it.
